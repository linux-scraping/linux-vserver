1. Overview
-----------

CFS is a proportional share scheduler which tries to divide the CPU time
proportionately between tasks or groups of tasks (task group/cgroup) depending
on the priority/weight of the task or shares assigned to groups of tasks.
In CFS, a task/task group can get more than its share of CPU if there are
enough idle CPU cycles available in the system, due to the work conserving
nature of the scheduler. However in certain scenarios (like pay-per-use),
it is desirable not to provide extra time to a group even in the presence
of idle CPU cycles. This is where hard limiting can be of use.

Hard limits for task groups can be set by specifying how much CPU runtime a
group can consume within a given period. If the group consumes more CPU time
than the runtime in a given period, it gets throttled. None of the tasks of
the throttled group gets to run until the runtime of the group gets refreshed
at the beginning of the next period.

2. Interface
------------

Hard limit feature adds 3 cgroup files for CFS group scheduler:

cfs_runtime_us: Hard limit for the group in microseconds.

cfs_period_us: Time period in microseconds within which hard limits is
enforced.

cfs_hard_limit: The control file to enable or disable hard limiting for the
group.

A group gets created with default values for runtime and period and with
hard limit disabled. Each group can set its own values for runtime and period
independent of other groups in the system.

3. Examples
-----------

# mount -t cgroup -ocpu none /cgroups/
# cd /cgroups
# mkdir 1
# cd 1/
# echo 250000 > cfs_runtime_us /* set a 250ms runtime or limit */
# echo 500000 > cfs_period_us /* set a 500ms period */
# echo 1 > cfs_hard_limit /* enable hard limiting for group 1/ */
